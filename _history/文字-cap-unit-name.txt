Look Up! The Sun is Shining
let's Go on a Picnic
We're Packing a Picnic Basket
Away From the City
Riding Down a Country Road
Green is Go
I Like My Rooster
Lazy Gus
Which Way?
Where is Your Right Hand?
We're Going to Plant a Tree
The Tree in the Hole
Sitting in a Little Boat
Jump-Splash!-Into the Water
How Deep is the Water?
Look at Me !
The Fish Eats the Worm
We're Hiking Through the Woods
Keep on Climbing
Skip Through the Field
If You Listen
Who Did It?
Open Your Hands and Close Them
Twigs and Branches, Twigs and Logs
The Lovely Ladies on Beautiful Horses
When the Sorcerer Wore His Magic Hat
I Can Put My Finger on Top of My Head
Open Your Hands and Close Them
